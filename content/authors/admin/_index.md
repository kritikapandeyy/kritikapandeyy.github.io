Hi, I’m Kritika Pandey. I operationalize data into analytics that teams use. Start with the why, map the how, build, test, and iterate. I’m a recent Data Analytics graduate from Humber College with 3+ years’ experience and a practical analyst who codes: Python • SQL • Power BI • Tableau. At Devant, I delivered automations and dashboards that answered specific questions and saved real hours.

I focus on human-centred analytics: blending statistics, automation, design, and marketing strategy to answer the “so what?” for stakeholders. My work spans event analytics, forecasting, survey insights, and operations/marketing reporting across education, nonprofit, public, and startup contexts.

If you value honest analysis, clean visuals, and rapid iteration from question to impact, let’s build something useful. 🙂
